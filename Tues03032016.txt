Reviewed networking and IP 
began work with css and html, created my first website ever. very neanderthal but worked locally non the less. 
Created a couple of batch files to show you the IP address and perform a shutdown.
this is moving a bit fast for my zero coding experience. 
Progress is inevitable.
