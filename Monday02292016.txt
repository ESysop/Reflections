Hello World
Today we went over some things I should have known better like HEX conversions. I will need to review octal conversions
We started to learn github commands and I want to research if there are ant training videos on Lynda.com 
tommorow we are going to cover CSS and html 5
Battery on the laptop only lasts about an hour
Power supply gets very hot and turns on and off, needs a heat sink and fan.
