Today I feel a little better but have not done much other than fix computer bugs.
I want to find some books or reference material maybe videos or something to try and get ready for a pretest on minday
I need to start typing in more code manually.
Need to find out what all the different functions are that can be imported are called and where to 
get a list of them.
