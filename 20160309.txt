Today was a complete disaster.
suposed to build a dice game as a team.
issues came up right away with git.
	we could not get a functional sync working amoung th 3 of us without merge conflicts.
	I was suposed to make the round class but could not get out of the box
	with about an hour left of class I do not have a starting point.
Mike spent some time with me today going over the robot we were supposed to make
 and I now have a little better understanding of the procss
 I really need some one on one with someone who can take it slow with me.
